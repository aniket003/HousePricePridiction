# House Price Prediction
> Advanced Linear Regression performed on the housing dataset as part of an assignment for coursework in the course Executive PG in Machine Learning and AI from IIIT Bangalore. 

## Business Goal 
You are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. This model will then be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the variables. They can accordingly manipulate the strategy of the firm and concentrate on areas that will yield high returns. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
